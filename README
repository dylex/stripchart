The stripchart program generates a stripchart-like plot of one or
more time-variant data values.  Typically, stripchart will be used to
plot performance metrics such as system load and net traffic.
However, its input mechanism is sufficently general purpose that the
program is adaptable to a broad range of plotting tasks.
